# LC6Analysis

LC6_Analysis.R	-- contains R code used for the anatomical analysis of LC6 and downstream neurons. Most EM figures (except connectivity matrices) were generated using this code.

LC6_Analysis_data.RData -- contains initial data for running LC6_Analysis.R. 

LC6_Analysis_workspace.7z.001	
LC6_Analysis_workspace.7z.002	
LC6_Analysis_workspace.7z.003
-- need to be upzipped. It contains the full workspace for LC6_Analysis.R. So you don't have to run the processing code and can readily make figures.


LC6_Analysis_connMatrix.R  -- contains R code to generate the connectivity matrices.

LC6_Analysis_connMatrix_data.RData	-- contains initial data for running LC6_Analysis_connMatrix.R

The rest are data and calibration files used by LC6_Analysis.R
